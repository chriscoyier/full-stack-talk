            I'm sure I've talked to thousands of other developers over the
            years, which has helped me understand the industry and the spectrum
            of work it takes to make websites happen.

          </ul>
          <p>
            This is important because it's not just semantics. It's a job that
            people are hired to do, and it is their job title at work. Nothing
            more personal than money.
          </p>
          <p>
            How we define what this job is and what the expectations are is
            personal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look at any job board that has technology jobs on it and you'll see
            postings for <strong>front-end developers</strong>.

              It deals very directly with the browser, devices, and users.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Everybody that works on websites probably has their browser open all
            day, but front-end developers <em>live</em> in there. They have
            DevTools open. They have multiple browsers open and test across
            versions and platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crucially, they care about the users that interact with those
            browsers and assistive technology.

            Mina Markham explains what a front-end developers is at a high

        <div>
          <p>
            There is a distinction from back-end developers. Its not that
            back-end developers don't care about users, it's just that
            responsibility is delegated.

            The browser is at the heart of the job of front-end development.
            Whatever you are doing, if your concern is how things ultimately
            look and work in a browser, that's front-end development.

          </ul>
          <p>
            Those are the languages that browsers speak. Yes yes, there is SVG
            and PNG and whatever else also, but you know what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever other tooling you use, it all comes down to what ships to
            the browser, and front-end developers are responsible for that.

          <p>
            As a twist though, not all front-end developers know all the
            languages equally well. In fact, there are lots of developers out
            there who hardly write any JavaScript at all, but who are otherwise
            very successful front-end developers. And there are certainly a lot
            of front-end developers who write almost nothing
            <em>but</em> JavaScript.

            Brad Frost coins the terms "Front of the Front" and "Back of the

            that it's not a weakness, but a strength in putting those different
            people together.

            Our jobs are already facinating! So we all deal with browsers and
            users and devices. That's core. But we all know different stuff, and
            actually put that knowledge to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of us are designers. Some of us are photographers. Some of us
            know the law really well. Some of us are way into performance. Some
            of us specialize in accessibility. Some of us embrace social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Metaphorically, you could map us like this tree.

        <div>
          <p>
            This metaphor probably doesn't hold up quite perfectly, but the
            divide looks a little something like this. We still share some
            fundamentals, and we still branch out and know lots of different
            stuff, but one side is heavily focused on JavaScript and "Back of
            the Front" type work and the other is not.

            Since this talk is about the slow morphing of front-end developers
            starting to do more full-stack work and having that role grow wider
            and wider, let's just assume we're talking about front-end
            developers who go down the heavier JavaScript road.

            To me, it seems non-JavaScript server-side rendered projects never
            really embraced components. You had templates and includes, but to
            me now, they feel like a pale comparison to real component-driven
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's facinating to see that while there is a wide variety of
            JavaScript-based frameworks that all disagree on plenty of things,
            one thing they all agree on is the idea of components. Even native
            web components... it's right in the name.

        <div>
          <p>
            Even this tiny little SVG icon? It's a component. We call it an
            <code>&lt;SVGIcon /></code> component because it nicely abstracts
            away a few things that are useful to us.
          </p>

      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Pairing an icon with a number is another component, because it is
            another repeated pattern and might have additional responsiblity,
            like being clicked.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            That whole row of MetaItem components might become a component,
            along with other aspects of an Item's display
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">

        <div>
          <p>
            So of course the whole Item itself becomes a component.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are visual and functional abstractions of what we need to
            build the UIs. There is semantic HTML underneath, but the
            abstractions are building blocks of our own devise.

        <div>
          <p>
            Larger and larger areas become components. In this case, it makes
            sense that a grid of items becomes a component, so that it can
            handle that layout and things like pagination.

            It's true! Not only are components capable of being intellegent
            building block abstractions for UIs for front-end developers,
            designers are largely already working this way. Tools like Figma,
            Sketch, and Adobe XD tout things like "symbols" which are
            spiritually connected.

            I find other developers are like "cool, components, I get it".

      <div class="slide-halfs">

            Dealing with URLs and overall site structure used to feel primarily
            like a back end concern. These days, "routing" is becoming more and
            more a front-end concern.

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.035.jpeg" alt="" />

            Looking back at the CodePen UI, the components don't stop at the
            grid. Literally everything becomes a component. The tabs, the
            titles, the buttons...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.036.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            ... the forms, the menus, the sidebar...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.037.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Ultimately the whole gosh-darned page becomes a component.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.038.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Once the whole page is a component, what you've really done is
            turned the the URL into a component.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.039.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            And now that the URL is a component, all the URLs are components,
            and you're controlling the whole site.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.040.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You've become an architect of the entire site, in a sense.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.041.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            That's... a lot. Think of all the work you already have to do as a
            front-end developer. None of that goes away. You're just responsible
            for a lot more now. It's no wonder that front-end developers are
            feeling more and more full-stack-y.
