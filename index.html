        I run the site <a href="https://css-tricks.com">CSS-Tricks</a> (which recently had its 12th birthday), a resource site all about building websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        I co-founded the site <a href="https://codepen.io">CodePen</a>, a social coding platform all about building things with front-end technology.

        I also co-host a podcast called <a href="https://shoptalkshow.com">ShopTalk Show</a> which is going on 400 episodes.

      <p>
        I'm sure I've talked to thousands of other developers over the years, which has helped me understand the industry and the spectrum of work it takes to make websites happen.

      <p>This is important because it's not just semantics. It's a job that people are hired to do, and it is their job title at work. Nothing more personal than money.</p>
      <p>How we define what this job is and what the expectations are is personal.</p>
      <p>Look at any job board that has technology jobs on it and you'll see postings for <strong>front-end developers</strong>.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Everybody that works on websites probably has their browser open all day, but front-end developers <em>live</em> in there. They have DevTools open. They have multiple browsers open and test across versions and platforms.</p>
      <p>Crucially, they care about the users that interact with those browsers and assistive technology.</p>

        The browser is at the heart of the job of front-end development. Whatever you are doing, if your concern is how things ultimately look and work in a browser, that's front-end development.

      <p>Those are the languages that browsers speak. Yes yes, there is SVG and PNG and whatever else also, but you know what I mean.</p>
      <p>Whatever other tooling you use, it all comes down to what ships to the browser, and front-end developers are responsible for that.</p>

        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are gonna come up at work.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a twist though, not all front-end developers know all the languages equally well. In fact, there are lots of developers out there who hardly write any JavaScript at all, but who are otherwise very successful front-end developers. And there are certainly a lot of front-end developers who write almost nothing <em>but</em> JavaScript.

        My article <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-great-divide/">The Great Divide</a> digs into the split between front-end developers who are deeply into JavaScript and those who are not.

        It's not just my thoughts, but a collection of quotes from many others who feel the divide.

        Brad Frost coins the terms "Front of the Front" and "Back of the Front" as a way to describe another sort of divide. He points out that it's not a weakness, but a strength in putting those different people together.

        There is no doubt about it. Particularly since about 2015, JavaScript has exploded as a language.

        Our jobs are already facinating! So we all deal with browsers and users and devices. That's core. But we all know different stuff, and actually put that knowledge to work. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us are designers. Some of us are photographers. Some of us know the law really well. Some of us are way into performance. Some of us specialize in accessibility. Some of us embrace social media.

        This metaphor probably doesn't hold up quite perfectly, but the divide looks a little something like this. We still share some fundamentals, and we still branch out and know lots of different stuff, but one side is heavily focused on JavaScript and "Back of the Front" type work and the other is not.

        Since this talk is about the slow morphing of front-end developers starting to do more full-stack work and having that role grow wider and wider, let's just assume we're talking about front-end developers who go down the heavier JavaScript road.
