            I'm sure I've talked to thousands of other developers over the
            years, which has helped me understand the industry and the spectrum
            of work it takes to make websites happen.

          </ul>
          <p>
            This is important because it's not just semantics. It's a job that
            people are hired to do, and it is their job title at work. Nothing
            more personal than money.
          </p>
          <p>
            How we define what this job is and what the expectations are is
            personal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look at any job board that has technology jobs on it and you'll see
            postings for <strong>front-end developers</strong>.

              It deals very directly with the browser, devices, and users.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Everybody that works on websites probably has their browser open all
            day, but front-end developers <em>live</em> in there. They have
            DevTools open. They have multiple browsers open and test across
            versions and platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crucially, they care about the users that interact with those
            browsers and assistive technology.

            Mina Markham explains what a front-end developers is at a high

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            There is a distinction from back-end developers. Its not that
            back-end developers don't care about users, it's just that
            responsibility is delegated.

            The browser is at the heart of the job of front-end development.
            Whatever you are doing, if your concern is how things ultimately
            look and work in a browser, that's front-end development.

              There are loads of tools involved, but ultimately it comes down to

          </ul>
          <p>
            Those are the languages that browsers speak. Yes yes, there is SVG
            and PNG and whatever else also, but you know what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever other tooling you use, it all comes down to what ships to
            the browser, and front-end developers are responsible for that.

            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They are gonna come up at work.

          <p>
            As a twist though, not all front-end developers know all the
            languages equally well. In fact, there are lots of developers out
            there who hardly write any JavaScript at all, but who are otherwise
            very successful front-end developers. And there are certainly a lot
            of front-end developers who write almost nothing
            <em>but</em> JavaScript.

            Brad Frost coins the terms "Front of the Front" and "Back of the
            Front" as a way to describe another sort of divide. He points out
            that it's not a weakness, but a strength in putting those different
            people together.

            Our jobs are already facinating! So we all deal with browsers and
            users and devices. That's core. But we all know different stuff, and
            actually put that knowledge to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of us are designers. Some of us are photographers. Some of us
            know the law really well. Some of us are way into performance. Some
            of us specialize in accessibility. Some of us embrace social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Metaphorically, you could map us like this tree.

        <div>
          <p>
            This metaphor probably doesn't hold up quite perfectly, but the
            divide looks a little something like this. We still share some
            fundamentals, and we still branch out and know lots of different
            stuff, but one side is heavily focused on JavaScript and "Back of
            the Front" type work and the other is not.

            Since this talk is about the slow morphing of front-end developers
            starting to do more full-stack work and having that role grow wider
            and wider, let's just assume we're talking about front-end
            developers who go down the heavier JavaScript road.

            To me, it seems non-JavaScript server-side rendered projects never
            really embraced components. You had templates and includes, but to
            me now, they feel like a pale comparison to real component-driven
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's facinating to see that while there is a wide variety of
            JavaScript-based frameworks that all disagree on plenty of things,
            one thing they all agree on is the idea of components. Even native
            web components... it's right in the name.

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Even this tiny little SVG icon? It's a component. We call it an
            <code>&lt;SVGIcon /></code> component because it nicely abstracts
            away a few things that are useful to us.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Pairing an icon with a number is another component, because it is
            another repeated pattern and might have additional responsiblity,
            like being clicked.
          </p>
        </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            That whole row of MetaItem components might become a component,
            along with other aspects of an Item's display
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            So of course the whole Item itself becomes a component.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are visual and functional abstractions of what we need to
            build the UIs. There is semantic HTML underneath, but the
            abstractions are building blocks of our own devise.
          </p>

      <div class="slide-halfs">

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Larger and larger areas become components. In this case, it makes
            sense that a grid of items becomes a component, so that it can

            It's true! Not only are components capable of being intellegent
            building block abstractions for UIs for front-end developers,
            designers are largely already working this way. Tools like Figma,
            Sketch, and Adobe XD tout things like "symbols" which are
            spiritually connected.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find other developers are like "cool, components, I get it".

            Dealing with URLs and overall site structure used to feel primarily
            like a back end concern. These days, "routing" is becoming more and
            more a front-end concern.

      <div class="slide-halfs">

          <p>
            Looking back at the CodePen UI, the components don't stop at the
            grid. Literally everything becomes a component. The tabs, the
            titles, the buttons...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.036.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            ... the forms, the menus, the sidebar...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.037.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Ultimately the whole gosh-darned page becomes a component.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.038.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Once the whole page is a component, what you've really done is
            turned the the URL into a component.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.039.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            And now that the URL is a component, all the URLs are components,
            and you're controlling the whole site.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.040.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            You've become an architect of the entire site, in a sense.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.041.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            That's... a lot. Think of all the work you already have to do as a
            front-end developer. None of that goes away. You're just responsible
            for a lot more now. It's no wonder that front-end developers are
            feeling more and more full-stack-y.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.042.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Another thing that has fallen into the hands of front-end developers
            is state management. Now that's kind of at the core of most
            JavaScript frameworks and it's a pretty great concept that wipes
            away a lot of front-end spaghetti problems of the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            But state is often filled from <em>getting</em> data, and that's now
            often on our shoulders as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more complicated is changing that data when necessary and
            sending data back to servers when required.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a pretty great answer
            to some of this. GraphQL is a lot of things and meaningful to
            different people in different ways. But to me, it's about
            empowerment.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a strong GraphQL endpoint in place, and tools like
            <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo</a> giving me tools
            to use in my JavaScript framework, I can, as a front-end developer,
            get my hands on any data I need to build UI.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.044.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Not only can I <em>get</em> data, but it's on me to update that data
            and send it back through GraphQL in the form of mutations.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.045.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Mutations aren't terribly more complicated than queries, but it's
            all the more work that is on my plate as a front-end developer. Work
            that was almost surely in the realm of back-end development before.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.046.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            While we're talking about components, queries, and mutations, let's
            throw one more thing on the pile: styling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Front-end developers have always been in charge of styling, but in a
            land of components that are self-contained in so many other ways, it
            starts to make sense to co-locate the styling information as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we're using
            <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a>
            to scope the styles to a specific component. We can and do still
            have global styles, and we even continue to use
            <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for useful global
            abstractions.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.047.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The result of this componentization and co-locating is nice little
            folders that have everything from logic, to view templates, to
            queries and mutations, to styling all together.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's convenient, but it has cool interesting side effects.
            JavaScript bundles only contain what they need. Styling doesn't get
            bloated because when components stop being used, their styles leave
            with them.
          </p>

            The GraphQL documentary is kinda fun. I like what Kyle Mathews says
            (about 20:24) about React wiping away a whole class of front-end
            development problems, and how GraphQL does a similar sort of thing.

            That's not to say that all of us need to know every single part of

          Let's draw a spectrum and see how that has morphed through time.

            LAMP is Linux, Apache, MySQL,and PHP. It's a rather old stack, but
            it's still very huge. It's what an awful lot of CMS's run. LAMP is
            how the stack is talked about.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I'm a front-end developer working in that stack, I'm way over on
            the other side of the spectrum, not touching much of the technology
            the stack is referring to.

          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, Angular is a front-end framework, so the stack is starting
            to include that. If I'm a front-end developer, what I'm working on
            overlaps with the stack.

            Serverless moves the stack further to the right. We don't even care
            what servers the code runs on anymore, it's just server-side code
            using and creating APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I'm a front-end developer working in this world, I overlap in
            that I might even be using my JavaScript abilities to be writing
            these serverless functions and digesting the APIs.

Following the inaugural [JAMstack_conf in San Francisco](https://2018.jamstackconf.com/) in 2018, we're now also bringing an edition to London where we'll have talks about how to design, develop, and deploy fast, modern web projects that run without web servers.</code></pre>

            <a href="https://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a> file with
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">Front Matter</a>
            to describe meta data associated with the conference, like the city
            and dates.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn't deliberately trying to avoid a database, but this just
            seemed like the perfect kind of site to use a
            <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/ssgs"
              >static site generator</a
            >
            for and the data needs are so basic that flat Markdown files are a
            natural fit.
          </p>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            So each conference is a Markdown file, and there are some basic
            templates in
            <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">Eleventy</a> is wonderful for
            processing that kind of setup.
          </p>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.067.jpeg" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The site is
            <a href="https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/conferences"
              >a public repo on GitHub</a
            >. That seems obvious, perhaps, but I think it's hugely significant
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            It means that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The entire site is in the repo. To run it, you pull it down and
              run a single command.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no fiddling with log ins, permissions, or credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
              It opens up the <em>content</em> of the site for public
              contributions, as well as the design and functionality. This has
              been huge.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">

        <div>
          <p>
            The site being on GitHub means I could just leave it on GitHub
            Pages, but it's like a 2-second process to put in on Netlify, which
            is a massive improvement. Here's a few reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/"
                >Deploy previews.</a
              >
              When I get a Pull Request, I can take a look at a live URL of what
              the site will be like with that Pull Request merged. Amazing.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can activate
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/"
                >Analytics</a
              >
              on the site and get the most accurate possible numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/image-transformation/"
                >fiddle with my images</a
              >
              programattically.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are a couple other big ones though...
          </p>

      <div class="slide-halfs">

          <p>
            With <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>, I get a
            UI to edit content right on the site itself. No code editing or Git
            involved at all once it's set up.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't even need Netlify to use Netlify CMS, but
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/"
              >Netlify Identity</a
            >
            makes the auth part a million times easier.

            Check out this feature of the conference site. For each conference,
            you can click a button that reveals an email input form. Enter an
            email and submit, and the site fires off an email with details about
            the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's a back-end thing. You can't really send email with
            client-side technology alone. You can communicate with APIs that
            will send email, but even that requires API keys that need to be
            kept secret via back-end code.

            I'll use <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/">Sparkpost</a> to send
            the email. They offer APIs to send email (that's the entire point).
            They also offer a Node.js library to make it very easy. Ultimately
            just a few lines of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that code? It's JavaScript. I'm a JavaScript developer. This is
            not a stretch.

            That's the meat and potatoes of serverless:
            <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/functions"
              >cloud functions</a
            >. I'm talking about
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>,
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"
              >Azure Functions</a
            >,
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/"
              >Google Cloud Functions</a
            >, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Netlify version, which is AWS Lamba under the hood, is
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/"
              >Netlify Functions</a
            >. It's amazing in that it's actually just like:
            <em
              >"toss your functions in a `/functions/` folder and we'll give you
              a relative URL to run them"</em
            >. Which is great.
