          </ul>
          <p>
            This is important because it's not just semantics. It's a job that
            people are hired to do, and it is their job title at work. Nothing
            more personal than money.
          </p>
          <p>
            How we define what this job is and what the expectations are
            <em>is personal</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look at any job board that has technology jobs on it and you'll see
            postings for <strong>front-end developers</strong>.

              It deals very directly with the browser, devices, and users.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Everybody that works on websites probably has their browser open all
            day, but front-end developers <em>live</em> in there. They have
            DevTools open. They have multiple browsers open and test across
            versions and platforms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crucially, they care about the users that interact with those
            browsers and assistive technology.

            Mina Markham explains what a front-end developers is at a high

        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            There is a distinction from back-end developers. Its not that
            back-end developers don't care about users, it's just that
            responsibility is delegated.
          </p>

            The browser is at the heart of the job of front-end development.
            Whatever you are doing, if your concern is how things ultimately
            look and work in a browser, that's front-end development.

              There are loads of tools involved, but ultimately it comes down to

          </ul>
          <p>
            Those are the languages that browsers speak. Yes yes, there is SVG
            and PNG and whatever else also, but you know what I mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whatever other tooling you use, it all comes down to what ships to
            the browser, and front-end developers are responsible for that.

            Not all front-end developers know all the languages equally well. In
            fact, there are lots of developers out there who hardly write any
            JavaScript at all, but who are otherwise very successful front-end
            developers. And there are also a lot of front-end developers who
            write almost nothing
            <em>but</em> JavaScript. ü§Ø

            Brad Frost coins the terms "Front of the Front" and "Back of the
            Front" as a way to describe another sort of divide. He points out
            that it's not a weakness, but a strength in putting those different
            people together.

            Our jobs are already facinating! So we all deal with browsers and
            users and devices. That's core. But we all know different stuff, and
            actually put that knowledge to work.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of us are designers. Some of us are photographers. Some of us
            know the law really well. Some of us are way into performance. Some
            of us specialize in accessibility. Some of us embrace social media.
          </p>
          <p>
            Metaphorically, you could map us like this tree.

          <p>
            This metaphor probably doesn't hold up quite perfectly, but the
            divide looks a little something like this. We still share some
            fundamentals, and we still branch out and know lots of different
            stuff, but one side is heavily focused on JavaScript and "Back of
            the Front" type work and the other is not.

            Since this talk is about the slow morphing of front-end developers
            starting to do more full-stack work and having that role grow wider
            and wider, let's just assume we're talking about front-end
            developers who go down the heavier JavaScript road.

            It seems to me non-JavaScript server-side rendered projects never
            really embraced components. (There are examples, don't @ me, but I
            mean across the gigantic PHP CMS landscape and Ruby on Rails and
            huge players like that.) You had templates and includes, but they
            are a pale comparison to real component-driven development.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's facinating to see that while there is a wide variety of
            JavaScript-based frameworks that all disagree on plenty of things,
            one thing they all agree on is the idea of components. Even native
            web components... it's right in the name.

            Even this tiny little SVG icon? It's a component. We call it an

            away a few things that are useful to us.

            Pairing an icon with a number is another component, because it is
            another repeated pattern and might have additional responsiblity,
            like being clicked.

            That whole row of MetaItem components might become a component,
            along with other aspects of an Item's display

        <div>
          <p>
            So of course the whole Item itself becomes a component.
          </p>
          <p>
            These are visual and functional abstractions of what we need to
            build the UIs. There is semantic HTML underneath, but the
            abstractions are building blocks of our own devise.

        <div>
          <p>
            Larger and larger areas become components. In this case, it makes
            sense that a grid of items becomes a component, so that it can
            handle that layout and things like pagination.

            It's true! Not only are components capable of being intellegent
            building block abstractions for UIs for front-end developers,
            designers are largely already working this way. Tools like Figma,
            Sketch, and Adobe XD tout things like "symbols" which are
            spiritually connected.
          </p>
          <p>
            I find other developers are like "cool, components, I get it".

            Another thing that has fallen into the hands of front-end developers
            is state management. Now that's kind of at the core of most
            JavaScript frameworks and it's a pretty great concept that wipes
            away a lot of front-end spaghetti problems of the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            But state is often filled from <em>getting</em> data, and that's now
            often on our shoulders as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more complicated is changing that data when necessary and
            sending data back to servers when required.

            <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> is a pretty great answer
            to some of this. GraphQL is a lot of things and meaningful to
            different people in different ways. But to me, it's about
            empowerment.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a strong GraphQL endpoint in place, and tools like
            <a href="https://www.apollographql.com/">Apollo</a> giving me tools
            to use in my JavaScript framework, I can, as a front-end developer,
            get my hands on any data I need to build UI.
          </p>

          <pre><code class="language-jsx">import gql from "graphql-tag";
import { Query } from "react-apollo";

const GET_DOGS = gql`
  {
    dogs {
      id
      breed
    }
  }
`;

const Dogs = () => (
  &lt;Query query={GET_DOGS}>
    {({ loading, error, data }) => {
      if (loading) return `Loading...`;
      if (error) return `Error`;

      return (
        {data.dogs.map(dog => (
          &lt;div key={dog.id}>

      );
    }}
  &lt;/Query>
);</code></pre>

          <p>
            Note that not only am I getting all my own data, I'm managing the
            asyncronous nature of the component. Should I show a skeleton right
            away? A spinner? Should I delay rendering until the data is ready?
            What happens if it times out or there is another error?
          </p>

            Not only can I <em>get</em> data, but it's <em>on me</em> update

            Mutations aren't terribly more complicated than queries, but it's
            all the more work that is on my plate as a front-end developer. Work
            that was almost surely in the realm of back-end development before.

          <p>
            While we're talking about components, queries, and mutations, let's
            throw one more thing on the pile: styling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Front-end developers have always been in charge of styling, but in a
            land of components that are self-contained in so many other ways, it
            starts to make sense to co-locate the styling information as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here we're using
            <a href="https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules">CSS modules</a>
            to scope the styles to a specific component. We can and do still
            have global styles, and we even continue to use
            <a href="https://sass-lang.com/">Sass</a> for useful global
            abstractions.
          </p>
          <pre><code class="language-css">.root {
  display: grid;
}</code></pre>
          <pre><code class="language-jsx">@import styles from './styles.scss';

&lt;NewsItems className={styles.root} /></code></pre>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.047.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The result of this componentization and co-locating is nice little
            folders that have everything from logic, to view templates, to
            queries and mutations, to styling all together.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's convenient, but it has cool interesting side effects. For
            example, JavaScript bundles may contain what they need (code
            splitting). Styling doesn't get
            <a
              href="https://css-tricks.com/oh-no-stylesheet-grows-grows-grows-append-stylesheet-problem/"
              >bloated</a
            >
            because when components stop being used because their styles leave
            with them. Not to mention naming things is a lot less stressful
            since the naming is file-scoped.

            For every project? Of course not. But for the somewhat large and

          Let's draw a spectrum and see how that has morphed through time.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-whole">
        <img src="slides/Oops.056.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.057.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            LAMP is Linux, Apache, MySQL,and PHP. It's a rather old stack, but
            it's still very huge. It's what an awful lot of CMS's run. LAMP is
            how the stack is talked about.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I'm a front-end developer working in that stack, I'm way over on
            the other side of the spectrum, not touching much of the technology
            the stack is referring to.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.058.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            MEAN is another stack, referring to MongoDB, Express, Angular, and
            Node. Notice the OS isn't mentioned anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notably, Angular is a front-end framework, so the stack is starting
            to include that. If I'm a front-end developer, what I'm working on
            overlaps with the stack.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.059.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Serverless moves the stack further to the right. We don't even care
            what servers the code runs on anymore, it's just server-side code
            using and creating APIs.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I'm a front-end developer working in this world, I overlap in
            that I might even be using my JavaScript abilities to be writing
            these serverless functions and digesting the APIs.
          </p>
        </div>

          <p>That's... like... <em>all</em> front end stuff.</p>
          <p>
            It seems to me the way we talk about the important technology that
            powers websites shifts more and more toward the front-end developer
            spectrum.

Following the inaugural [JAMstack_conf in San Francisco](https://2018.jamstackconf.com/) in 2018, we're now also bringing an edition to London where we'll have talks about how to design, develop, and deploy fast, modern web projects that run without web servers.</code></pre>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            Each conference is a
            <a href="https://commonmark.org/">Markdown</a> file with
            <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/">Front Matter</a>
            to describe meta data associated with the conference, like the city
            and dates.
          </p>
          <p>
            I wasn't deliberately trying to avoid a database, but this just
            seemed like the perfect kind of site to use a
            <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/ssgs"
              >static site generator</a
            >
            for and the data needs are so basic that flat Markdown files are a
            natural fit.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.066.png" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            So each conference is a Markdown file, and there are some basic
            templates in
            <a href="https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/">Nunjucks</a>, and
            <a href="https://www.11ty.io/">Eleventy</a> is wonderful for
            processing that kind of setup.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.067.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The site is
            <a href="https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/conferences"
              >a public repo on GitHub</a
            >. That seems obvious, perhaps, but I think it's hugely significant
            here.
          </p>
          <p>
            It means that:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The entire site is in the repo. To run it, you pull it down and
              run a single command.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no fiddling with log ins, permissions, or credentials.
            </li>
            <li>
              It opens up the <em>content</em> of the site for public
              contributions, as well as the design and functionality. This has
              been huge.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.068.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            The site being on GitHub means I could just leave it on GitHub
            Pages, but it's like a 2-second process to put in on Netlify, which
            is a massive improvement. Here's a few reasons:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/"
                >Deploy previews.</a
              >
              When I get a Pull Request, I can take a look at a live URL of what
              the site will be like with that Pull Request merged. Amazing.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can activate
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/"
                >Analytics</a
              >
              on the site and get the most accurate possible numbers.
            </li>
            <li>
              I can
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/image-transformation/"
                >fiddle with my images</a
              >
              programattically.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There are a couple other big ones though...
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="slide-halfs">
        <div>
          <img src="slides/Oops.069.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>
            With <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">Netlify CMS</a>, I get a
            UI to edit content right on the site itself. No code editing or Git
            involved at all once it's set up.
          </p>
          <p>
            I don't even need Netlify to use Netlify CMS, but
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/"
              >Netlify Identity</a

            Check out this feature of the conference site. For each conference,
            you can click a button that reveals an email input form. Enter an
            email and submit, and the site fires off an email with details about
            the conference.
          </p>
          <p>
            That's a back-end thing. You can't really send email with
            client-side technology alone. You can communicate with APIs that
            will send email, but even that requires API keys that need to be
            kept secret via back-end code.

            I'll use <a href="https://www.sparkpost.com/">Sparkpost</a> to send
            the email. They offer APIs to send email (that's the entire point).
            They also offer a Node.js library to make it very easy. Ultimately
            just a few lines of code.
          </p>
          <p>
            And that code? It's JavaScript. I'm a JavaScript developer. This is
            not a stretch.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I <em>run</em> this?</h3>

          <p>
            That's the meat and potatoes of serverless:
            <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/services/functions"
              >cloud functions</a
            >. I'm talking about
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a>,
            <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/"
              >Azure Functions</a
            >,
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/functions/"
              >Google Cloud Functions</a
            >, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Netlify version, which is AWS Lamba under the hood, is
            <a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/"
              >Netlify Functions</a
            >. It's stupid easy. You just toss your functions in a `/functions/`
            folder and run them by hitting a relative URL.

      </div>

      <div class="slide-whole">
        <h2>
          It feels very powerful to be able to build the entire site from front
          to back like that.
        </h2>
        <h2>
          Let's revisit the spectrum of technology again with this modern stuff

        <img src="slides/Oops.076.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        <p>
          I don't really have to care about operating systems and servers.
          Entire products can be built without having to care about these.

      </div>

      <div class="slide-whole">
        <img src="slides/Oops.078.jpeg?nf_resize=fit&w=1000" alt="" />
        <p>
          I probably don't need to care much about databases either. It's not
          that databases aren't important, it's just that my dealing with data
          is likely to happen through APIs. Perhaps a Headless CMS (e.g.
          <a href="https://www.contentful.com/">Contentful</a>). Perhaps a data
          storage tool that is designed to work through APIs (e.g.
          <a href="https://fauna.com/">FaunaDB</a>) or on-page libraries (e.g.
          <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore">Firestore</a>).

        <p>
          So now I'm left with a spectrum of technology where I can work with
          all parts of it.

            "Actual" unicorns, those people that are very good at every task
            across the entire spectrum of building websites: as rare as actual
            unicorns.

            I'm also not trying to insinuate that back-end developers are
            becoming obsolete. In fact, the fact that building websites has
            gotten so damn complex, they are more important than ever.
          </p>

            Right now, I can open up the CodePen issue tracker and see 89 issues
            that I can't solve alone. I need back-end developer help to dig into
            them and fix them. I can think of myself as full-stacky if I want,
            but I know that back-end stuff is where my rough edges are.

            That's not to make fun of anybody. I mean, maybe a little, but it
            draws a nice metaphor that is kinda perfect for this talk. We are
            the whole horse! The whole dragon! But we've got rough edges. So
            what.

            It's cool to see the tech around our job evolve to the point that we
            <em>can</em> reach our arms around the whole thing. It's worthy of
            some concern when we feel like complication of web technology feels
            like it's raising the barrier to entry. That happens sometimes and
            it's not great. But it's also worthy of cheer when web technology
            becomes simple enough that people can build things from start to
            finish all by themselves. That's pretty cool.

            While we're being all productive and amazing, let's just remember
            that <strong>doing a good job is everybodies job.</strong>
          </p>
          <ul class="colored-list">
            <li>Good UX is everyone's job</li>
            <li>Good performance is everyone's job</li>
            <li>Good security is everyone's job</li>
            <li>Good accessibility is everyone's job</li>
            <li>
              Doing right by the people that use your website is everyone's job
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Even if you aren't writing the code that directly affects any of
            those things, you care about them and fight for them to be handled
            well.
